This workflow allows you to pull lithostratigraphy and well data of a field from [Netherland Oil and Gas Portal](https://www.nlog.nl/datacenter/). It will save lithostratigraphy data of each well as a single JSON file and collect well informations as a pandas dataframe. I choose The Groningen Field in this example, a well-studied, prolific gas field in the Netherlands with 300+ wells which I want to play around with the data later on. But, feel free to use and modify it to pull another field dataset to serve for your own purpose.
